They easily put in 100 hours.\n\nPM may already have lots of money.\n\nIf you want to compare, compare with the middle class people.\n\nRecently I saw someone saying that all people get gaaliya, even celebrities do.\n\nHow can you compare a problem like this with elite people?\n\nEven if celebrities, cricketers etc get gaaliya, they earn a lot more than us.\n\nA middle class person can work for 6 days * 14 hours but the question is -\n\nWill you pay us fairly?",
